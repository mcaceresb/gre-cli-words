If you can find them, read 5s and 6s and try to figure out what makes a 6 a 6. Don't be afraid to be pedantic, and definitely write practice essays.

1. For the issue essay:
    - Choose a FIRM position and DO NOT WAFFLE: Either agree or disagree. The person grader won't care and the e-grader DEFINITELY won't care. What matters is that you can structure an argument coherently.
    - Write a 6 paragraph-essay
        - Write down 2 real-world examples and 1 hypothetical example.
        - Write-down the counter to your thesis and then counter that counter.
        - Write conclusion.
        - Write intro.
    - Try to vary sentence length.
    - Use sophisticated sentence connections.
    - Try not to be repetitive when it comes to vocabulary.

2. For the argument essay:
    - Find the implication/assumption/etc. used in the argument and state it in the intro.
    - There will be plenty that can be questioned. This is by design. Choose 3 key things and drop the rest.
    - Write a 5 paragraph-essay
        - 3 argument flaws (though if the prompt asks for something specific, be sure to include it).
        - Conclusion
            - Summarize assumptions.
            - Explain what we can do about it.
        - Introduction
            - Identify the assumption.
            - Outline what is wrong.
    - Real-world examples are not necessary, but a bit of theory is great (e.g. statistics or economics lingo, like selection bias, randomization, sampling bias, measurement error, sorting, sample size, etc.)
    - It should read off as a bullet list of what is wrong with the argument with a preface and an afterthought.

3. For both essays, you need to beat the e-grader
    - Use PRECISE vocabulary.
    - VARY sentence length.
    - VERY sentence structure.
    - Add a colon: It's good to be creative with punctuation.
    - A well-placed semi-colon can connect two distinct ideas; an ill-placed semi-colon will make the connection appear forced.
    - Add an em-dash if it is appropriate---it adds emphasis.
    - Parentheses are also good to have (to add nuance).
    - An appositive, which when adequately used intimates precise knowledge of the subject matter, will improve your score.
    - Focus on flow and structure.
    - Don't be redundant. Go back and rephrase.

4. State things authoritatively and as if they were unequivocally true.
    - NO first person.
    - NO passive voice.

5. Be sure to READ THE PROMPT! It will likely include a directive and you should be responding to that directive.

In case you're curious I got a 5.5 (I would bet my 5 was in the issue essay) so take that part with a bigger grain of salt!
