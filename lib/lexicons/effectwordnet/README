The +/-Effect sense-level lexicon in the file "goldStandard.tff" were created
by the annotators.

The +/-Effect sense-level lexicon in the file "EffectWordNet.tff" were created
by the work presented in:

Yoonjung Choi and Janyce Wiebe. +/-EffectWordNet: Sense-level Lexicon Acquisition
for Opinion Inference. EMNLP 2014.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. WordNet

We used WordNet 3.0 provided by Princeton University.


II. Format of the lexicon

Each line in the file contains one sense (synset).  Below is an example:

synset_offset \t type \t synset \t gloss

a. synset_offset - provided by WordNet 3.0

b. type - +Effect, -Effect, or Null
    +Effect: A synset has positive effects on entities
    -Effect: A synset has negative effects on entities
    Null: Neither +Effect nor -Effect

c. synset - A synonym set

d. gloss - A definition and optionally example sentences of the synset.
